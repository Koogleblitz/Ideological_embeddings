# Ideological_embeddings

Objective:
The primary goal of the ideological embeddings model is to uncover and represent the ideological positions of individuals based on their interactions with various content. This content, in the form of textual documents, encompasses a wide range of ideological statements, including political opinions, social values, and policy stances.

Data Collection:
The model uses a corpus of textual documents as its input. Each document represents a statement or opinion related to different ideological topics, such as economic policies, social issues, environmental concerns, or geopolitical conflicts. The expanded corpus includes diverse viewpoints to capture a broad spectrum of ideologies.

Text Preprocessing:
Before analysis, the text undergoes preprocessing using the CountVectorizer from the sklearn library. This step involves:

Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
Stop Words Removal: Filtering out common words (like "and," "the," etc.) that do not contribute to the ideological meaning.
Vectorization: Converting the text into a matrix of token counts, where each row represents a document and each column represents a unique word from the corpus.
Topic Modeling:
The model employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model, to identify latent topics within the corpus. LDA assumes that each document is a mixture of topics, and each topic is characterized by a distribution over words. The key steps include:

Determining Topics: LDA processes the document-term matrix to identify K distinct topics, where K is predefined (in this case, set to 5).
Extracting Topic Words: For each topic, LDA identifies the most significant words that characterize the topic. These words help in interpreting the nature of each topic.
Simulating User Interactions:
To model user ideologies, the framework simulates user interactions with the documents:

User-Document Interactions: Each user is randomly associated with a subset of documents, representing their exposure or engagement with specific ideological content.
User Network Simulation: An adjacency matrix (E) is created to simulate the network of users, indicating which users are connected or influenced by each other.
Ideological Embeddings:
The core of the model involves calculating ideological embeddings, represented by two matrices:

Polarities (phi): This matrix captures the alignment of each user with the identified topics. Each element in the matrix indicates the degree to which a user aligns with a particular topic.
Interests (theta): This matrix indicates the level of interest each user has in the topics. Higher values suggest stronger engagement or concern with the topic.
Training Process:
The model iteratively updates the phi and theta matrices using a gradient ascent approach:

Alignment Probability: The function alignment_probability calculates the probability that two users align ideologically on a specific topic, based on their phi values.
Updating Matrices: For each epoch, the model updates the phi and theta matrices based on observed user-document interactions and negative sampling (to account for unobserved interactions).
Visualization and Interpretation:
The final step involves visualizing the ideological embeddings:

2D Visualization: Users are plotted in a 2D space using the first two dimensions of the phi matrix. Each point represents a user, positioned according to their ideological stance.
Interpreting Positions: The visualization helps in understanding the relative ideological positions of users, with closer points indicating similar ideologies.
Applications and Insights:
This model provides several valuable insights:

Identifying Ideological Clusters: The model can reveal clusters of users with similar ideological positions, useful for understanding group dynamics.
Topic Influence Analysis: By examining the theta values, one can assess which topics are most engaging or polarizing among users.
Comparative Analysis: The model enables comparisons between different user groups or across different topics, highlighting areas of consensus or division.
